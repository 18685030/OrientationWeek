# UoL Orientation Week - 5th - 9th October 2020

## Student Engagement

This repo is a development area for the SoCs orientation week materials for student engagement that I have been asked to help with. These are:

1. CyberSecurity Challenge
1. Virtual Escape Room

## Note

This is nothing to do with the UoL SU directly and is a separate set of activities to compliment and help new starters make new friends and feel comfortable with the SoCS as quickly as possible. Currently, these activities are timetabled around 15:00-18:00 after the main days events.
